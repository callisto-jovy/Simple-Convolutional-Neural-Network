# CNNTCD (Convolutional Neural Network To Classify Dogs)

## What is this project?

This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN for short) written in pure Java from scratch.
The projects premise is to illustrate, how and why a CNN works and operates.  
The network has been trained with images from
the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)
and the [Cat dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset) as well as various other images.

## Why build the CNN from scratch?

As mentioned before, the project's goal is to illustrate a CNN, or AI in general. Though no fancy mechanisms are in
place
to graphically depict the network, it is the network and the code itself which aims to illustrate on a more abstract
plane.
